Journalists gather a crap-ton of information. So much of it has traditionally fallen into unused notebooks. Words stay stuck on voice recorder tapes and audio files. A whole backlog of source information never makes it to the public.

But there's no reason to hold back basic, contextual information about a topic, and one of the goals of seattle.io is to share what we learn, as we learn it â€“ in an open and accessible way. 

[SeattleWiki](http://seattlewiki.net) is our open reporter's notebook. Similar to the concept of an [open science notebook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science), except applied to journalism.

At seattle.io we produce books about local topics and post the raw information to SeattleWiki.net.

That allows anyone to follow along with our work and help guide our coverage by adding information to the wiki. In the book we'll credit contributors who have helped edit relevant pages on the wiki.

Our first book, about local indie game developers, requires research and documentation of all things indie games in Seattle. You can follow that work at [seattlewiki.net/games](http://seattlewiki.net/games). 

SeattleWiki isn't just ours to edit.

The wiki is maintained by [Code for Seattle](http://codeforseattle.org) (which I am also involved in as an organizer). The goal of SeattleWiki is for residents of Seattle to use it as a resource to find and share hyperlocal information. The content, with a Creative Commons license, can then be used by any organization creating apps around local information.

Any news organization can use SeattleWiki as their open reporter's notebook. Any locally-focused programmers can help populate content and use it in their apps via the wiki's awesome API.

Cities need a collaborative resource for maintaining local knowledge. The more organizations that use SeattleWiki as a knowledge base for their work, the more everyone benefits.

SeattleWiki isn't our only method for sharing what we're working on as we produce the indie games book.

Here on seattle.io we'll post feature articles and excerpts from interviews and other pieces from chapters of the book. We'll use our [tumblr blog](http://seattleio.tumblr.com) and [twitter](http://twitter.com/seattleio) to report timely news about local indie games and other topics.
