Every few months game developers all over the interwebs converge to compete in [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/), a competition where participants make a game in a weekend!

In Seattle there was a post-competition [show & tell](http://www.meetup.com/SeattleGamesCooperative/events/134408862/) at [Hub Seattle](http://thehubseattle.com). Here's a rundown of the games that people brought to demo:

## Temple
![temple screenshot](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/273708/22908-shot0.png)

[Demo](http://threebeards.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/) / [Entry page](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/?action=preview&uid=22908).

A fun top-down run through a maze with sharp spikes. 10 seconds get through each room!

## Saccade

[Demo](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/624450) / [Entry page](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/?action=preview&uid=14285).

A saccade is a fast movement of the eye, and you'll be doing a lot of that in this game. The goal is to shoot the red tanks as they move down the screen, and they're just far enough apart that you have to glance back and forth to see each row of tanks.


## Cast out

[Demo](http://www.rekindlegames.com/Alpha/Cast_Out_LD_27.html) / [Entry page](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/?action=preview&uid=25458).

Exercise demons! You only have 10 seconds! QUICK HURRY.



## Omnidirectional Chaos

[Demo](http://mattarod.com/chaosjam2x.html) / [Entry page](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/?action=preview&uid=15824).

You can try to survive for 10 seconds in this game, but you probably won't. At least not for the first 50-100 tries. Totally worth it.


## MSM – MumiaSnowdenManning

## Ten Seconds of Thrust

[Demo](http://www.stencyl.com/game/play/21025) / [Entry page](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/?action=preview&uid=19657).

Carefully fly your ship to safety from a solar flare! You've got 60 seconds! And you only have 10 seconds worth of main thruster fuel!


## Second’s Showdown

[Demo](http://games.spottedzebrasoftware.com/seconds-showdown/) / [Entry page](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/?action=preview&uid=15160).

One of the few games that didn't use 10 seconds in a literal way, and instead made use of an esoteric aspect of dueling: each participant in a duel has a "second" to check that weapons in a duel are equal and that the match is fair. This is a 2-player game, so find a bud and duel.



## Monster Every 10 Seconds

[Demo](http://sethvincent.github.io/ludum-dare-27/) / [Entry page](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/?action=preview&uid=5625).

This is the game I made for Ludum Dare. Originally I wanted to make a game like [Candy Box]() and [A Dark Room](). By the end of the competition I had the beginnings of a side-scrolling game instead. These things happen.


You can also play a revised version of this game here: [superbigtree.com/mossybellies](http://superbigtree.com/mossybellies/) and on the [front page of this site](http://seattle.io)!
