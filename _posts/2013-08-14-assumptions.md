seattle.io has a somewhat different approach to publishing than traditional media. 

Outlined here are assumptions about publishing that we will put to the test throughout the development of seattle.io. We'll refine these assumptions into guiding principles for a sustainable business model for publishing across diverse platforms.

### Let the news of the day be free. It already is.
Focus free content on events. Focus purchasable content on narrative about people, places, things.

Charge for comprehensive content that people need for research. Use free content to drive interest and document the events of the day.

Aggregation and timely reporting is free. Context and storytelling is part of a package for purchase.

### Paywalls are ugly and stupid. Don’t do that.
People will pay for content if it is packaged in interesting ways, particularly if bundled with other products and services. People will pay much less for content that’s just behind a paywall.

Make awesome, sellable products that people will like. Make products that convey aspects of your organization’s community or topic with a focus on storytelling, context, and comprehensiveness.

Make ebooks, films, and apps.

Make weird things that don’t make sense. People will probably like that – it’ll certainly be more interesting than a nasty paywall.

Bundle the products you create with related goods and services. 

Example: [make an ebook about local indie game developers and bundle locally-made games with the book](http://seattle.io).

### Practice "lean" publishing.
Test content by making early versions available for free. Evaluate response, create more meaningful, in-depth, paid versions based on response.

This is lean publishing. This is what [Leanpub](http://leanpub.com) encourages. Technical book publishers like O’Reilly, Manning, and Apress do this when they release “early access” versions of a book.

Start by testing ideas via social media. 

Use wikis (like SeattleWiki) as a kind of "open reporter's notebook" to document your research. Use discussion forums and link-sharing sites (like reddit & hacker news) to participate in discussions about relevant topics. 

If people like something, expand on it. 

Write a blog post about the topic. If people are into the blog post, consider creating a book, film, or app based on that topic. Explore, start small, and build on what works.

Cover unpopular topics when they have influence on the lives and decision-making of the community.

### Don’t sell advertising space.
A news organization must create and promote its own products and services instead of advertising other companies.

Advertising only makes serious money when traffic is big, but making a decent number of direct sales can happen even with a relatively small audience.

### Produce and sponsor the development of open-source software, & create products and services around technology.

Support those in your community that build open-source software through donation and employment. Contribute via [GitTip](https://www.gittip.com/). Hire open-source developers as contractors and include work on relevant open-source code as part of the contract.

Create open-source software that supports your business and contributes to the existing options available for publishers.

### Be involved in digital inclusion and education efforts
Get involved in digital inclusion efforts that support those in the community who do not have internet access or are not as technologically literate.

Teach a diverse group how to code and use software development tools. Teach them the process of gathering, organizing, analyzing, and distributing information.

These people will be the next reporters, editors, designers, developers. Get them involved in your organization. Train them. Give them a platform.
