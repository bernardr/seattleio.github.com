You make games. We want to hear about it.

The team at seattle.io is interviewing all the people who make games in Seattle, and we'd love to hear from you! We're working on a project called <i><a href="http://seattle.io/play-local">Play Local</a></i>, a series of zines about locally-made games and the people who make them.

We have a focus on indie game makers, but even if you're at a large game studio in Seattle, we'd like to hear about your experiences making games.

What makes Seattle a good place to make games? Why do you make games? We'd like to talk to you about who you are, what games you're making, how people can find and play your games, and how people can get involved in the Seattle games community.

Introduce yourself by answering a few questions here: 

<a href="#" target="_blank" class="button">Interview about you & your games!</a>

We'll use your answers for a blog post about you/your game with your permission.
