Join us on February 3 for a JavaScript workshop that will act as an introduction to the language and to creating interactive graphics using the canvas tag.

<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/seattle-io/events/155670922/" class="btn button" target="_blank">Sign up for the workshop</a></p>

### We'll go over: 
- Javascript syntax, functions, data types
- The API for the HTML5 canvas tag
- Creating the beginnings of a basic game with javascript.
- An introduction to libraries for creating interactive graphics 

This workshop is designed for beginners, is a refined version of previous Javascript workshops, and is based on content from the Learn.js book series about Javascript, which you can learn about at [learnjs.io](http://learnjs.io). 

It's well-suited to someone who has tinkered with Javascript, who has taken [codecademy.com](http://codecademy.com) courses, or who is experienced with HTML and CSS and is interested in creating interactive graphics with Javascript.

If you're new to Javascript, this workshop will still be useful, but I recommend that you first complete the lessons at [codecademy.com/tracks/javascript](http://codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) and/or [codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-1](http://codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-1) as an introduction to the language.

The workshop is $50, and you can register through [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/seattle-io/events/155670922/).
