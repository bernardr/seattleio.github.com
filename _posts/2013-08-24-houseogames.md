[HouseOgames](http://houseogames.com) is an incubator for game development companies, and kind of a weird one.

It's a year-long [incubation program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_incubator), which is somewhat surprising – common lengths for this kind of program are 3 to 6 months. HouseOgames offers this in exchange for a percentage of revenues from sales of the games that teams release while in the program.

It's easy to imagine a video games paradise when thinking about HouseOgames.

Maybe there'll be a lab with all kinds of consoles and other game platforms ready to help you test your game. Maybe there'll be all-night game competitions among the residents – both for making and playing games. Maybe there'll be extraordinary feats of game design, and the powers of the teams combined create an immense and indestructible supergame that no rival can challenge.

Hopefully it won't be Real World: Seattle Indie Games.

Game development teams will move into the house in Lynnwood (north of Seattle) and live there for free. They'll get business and production mentoring, a fun environment for building a game, and they'll get to focus on what they love: making games.

For a year.

In September 2013 people start moving into the house. There'll be someone living there who will be dedicated to helping teams with audio for their games, and another person who will help with marketing and promotion.

How does someone participate in HouseOgames?

The criteria for selecting teams is something like this:
You want to sell your game.
You have a history of making games.
You're interesting.

It doesn't matter what platform you develop games for.

There isn't much time left. If you're interested in being one of the teams and want to learn more, apply by August 30 on the HouseOgames website: [houseogames.com/team-submisson](http://houseogames.com/team-submisson/)
