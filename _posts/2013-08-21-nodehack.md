Node.Hack is a surprising game.

I started to say out loud that I didn't expect it to be as fun as it is, but I remembered its creator sitting across the table.

"I think surprising is a great word for Node.Hack," said Charles Cox, founder of 4gency, the company behind Node.Hack. "It kind of sneaks up on you."

At nodehackgame.com I'm told I can hack systems, destroy artificial intelligence, and steal millions. And the pleasant, minimal design of the cubes in the game looks cool, but how could it be like hacking?

The game's simple visual design is paired with minimalist gameplay elements that truly work as metaphors for sneaking, stealing, and hacking one's way through a system. It's abstract. It works.

"In a lot of ways, the fact that Node.Hack is surprising could be seen as a bit of a failure," said Cox. "I’m willing to say that’s a lesson learned."

"If I could convey the excitement and the intrigue and all those things that  you feel when you play Node.Hack -  if I can convey them to you faster before you bought the game so that you were convinced you were going to have this feeling – that’d be a better move, but it’s so subtle, how do you do it?"

Charles is a programmer turned project manager. He created the first version of Node.Hack on his own with music from John Manchester of Manchester Music. 

The current version was a team effort:

- Alexander Schoner - Creative Director
- Nick Gravelyn - Engineer/Architect
- Brian Woods - Music / SFX
- Matt Storm - Marketing

Matt left to create [The Masonry](http://www.themasonryseattle.com), a brew pub and woodfired pizza place in Queen Anne.

On Node.Hack, Charles worked with a small team on nights and weekends outside of their day jobs. He said they nailed the execution, but that they can do bigger and better.

"And I won’t say there weren’t heroics, because there were," Cox said.  "But it doesn’t follow that traditional indie model where everybody’s eating ramen or not eating anything at all and they’re not sleeping, they’re just sitting there coding and they grow giant beards."

With the next 4gency game, Charles will expand the team and take on a more ambitious project.

Charles wouldn't give details about the upcoming project.

That'll be a surprise.
