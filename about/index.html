  <h1>About.</h1>

  <p>The first project of seattle.io is to research local topics in Seattle, WA, and compile what we learn into digital books.</p>

  <p>Each book will include interviews with local folks about what they do, why they do it, and how they do it. In addition, each book will include how-to guides for getting involved with that topic, and a comprehensive directory for learning more about the topic.</p>

  <p>We also bundle each book with related items. For instance, with the book about local indie game developers we'll bundle the book with games from some of those developers.</p>
  <br>

  <p><b>Goals of seattle.io:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Build a community of entrepreneurs and technologists focused on journalism and publishing in Seattle.</li>
    <li>Create in-depth resources serving residents of Seattle and the surrounding area.</li>
    <li>Experiment with the intersection of storytelling and technology.</li>
    <li>Support the development of open-source technology and the open-source community in Seattle.</li>
    <li>Develop sustainable business and publishing models for journalism that can be replicated in other communities.</li>
  </ul>
