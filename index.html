        <h5>About seattle.io:</h5>
        <p>The goal: research local topics in Seattle, WA, and compile what we learn into a digital book.</p>
        <p>Each book will include interviews with local folks about what they do, why they do it, and how they do it. In addition, each book will include how-to guides for getting involved with that topic, and a comprehensive directory for learning more about the topic.</p>
        <p>We also bundle each book with related items. For instance, with the book about local indie game developers we'll bundle the book with games from some of those developers.</p>
        <h5>Possible upcoming topics:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Guide to Civics</li>
          <li>Theater of Seattle</li>
          <li><a href="mailto:hi@learnjs.io">Suggest other topics we should cover.</a></li>
